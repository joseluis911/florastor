        <h1>What Are Probiotics?</h1>
        <p>Health Canada and the World Health Organization define probiotics as "live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host."<sup><a href="/references/">8</a></sup> The human body hosts approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, also known as microbiota or microflora. When the flora in your digestive system becomes imbalanced due to antibiotics, viruses, or unfriendly bacteria, it can lead to abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. Probiotics help balance your gut flora to support a healthy digestive system.</p>

            <h1>The History of Florastor<sup>&reg;</sup></h1>
            <br>
            <p>While traveling in Indochina in the early 1920’s, Henri Boulard, a French microbiologist, noticed the locals making a special drink—made from lychee and mangosteen—to help with digestion. Fascinated by the healing properties of the mysterious active ingredient from these two tropical fruits, Boulard conducted further research. He later identified the natural active ingredient as a specific strain of yeast and named his discovery <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em>.</p>
            <p><em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em> was first introduced in 1953 by Biocodex, an independent and family-owned French pharmaceutical company. Since then, Biocodex has safeguarded and manufactured this well-studied probiotic strain using a patented freeze drying process known as lyophilization. <em>Saccharomyces boulardii lyo</em> CNCM I-745 is the specific strain discovered by Henri Boulard and licensed by Biocodex—now sold in over 100 countries.</p>
            <p>Florastor is the only probiotic supplement in North America featuring <em>Saccharomyces boulardii lyo</em> CNCM I-745. With over 60 years of use and 70 clinical research studies supporting this proven strain, Florastor is the trusted probiotic of choice by families worldwide.<a href="/references/"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
